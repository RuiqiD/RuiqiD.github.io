				<summary>Deng, R., Benckendorff, P., & Gannaway, D. (2020). Linking learner factors, teaching context, and engagement patterns with MOOC learning outcomes. <i>Journal of Computer Assisted Learning</i> (Early view).</summary>
				<p id="details"> Abstract: Prior studies of MOOC learners have focused almost exclusively on behavioural and social aspects of engagement. This paper extends the scope of previous studies by adopting a multi‐dimensional, person‐centred approach to investigate learner engagement in MOOCs. An analysis of 1,452 self‐administered survey responses uncovered three prototypical categories of MOOC learners based on patterns of behavioural, cognitive, emotional and social engagement: (a) “Individually Engaged” learners, (b) “Least Engaged” learners and (c) “Wholly Engaged” learners. The study revealed significant differences among the three cohorts of MOOC participants with respect to learner factors (gender, origin, motivation), teaching context (course level, course duration, form of the assessment) and learning outcomes (course completion, perceived quality of instruction). The results of this study suggest that adopting a multi‐dimensional, person‐centred approach can be useful for researchers and practitioners to classify MOOC learners into subpopulations, design effective educational interventions that best engage different types of learners, and provide support and scaffolding to individuals with idiosyncratic or problematic engagement patterns.<br><br>
				Key findings:<br>
				1. To optimise engagement and learning outcomes, educators and learning designers should address MOOC participants’ <b>extrinsic motivations</b> (e.g. academic and career needs) when configuring the teaching and learning space.<br>
				2. Engagement and learning outcomes can be improved by making a course more intellectually stimulating. Educators and learning designers should avoid enticing enrolments by simply making the course <b>easier</b>.<br>
				3. Engagement can be enhanced by incorporating <b>assessment tasks</b> and taking advantage of <b>human-graded assessment strategies</b> where appropriate.<br>
				4. Reducing the <b>duration</b> of a MOOC is not the best way to increase engagement.<br><br>

				<p id="details">Abstract: The purpose of this study is to contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of conceptualising and measuring learner engagement in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The paper develops and validates a MOOC engagement scale (MES) to measure learner engagement. The initial questionnaire items of the scale were developed by reviewing existing related literature and validated student engagement constructs. This was followed by a modified scale development process, including two focus group interviews (n = 10), an exploratory survey (n = 12), an expert review (n = 10), a pilot survey (n = 15), an item purification study (n = 590) and a construct validation study (n = 303). The final version of the scale is made up of four dimensions: behavioural engagement, cognitive engagement, emotional engagement and social engagement. The paper concludes with recommendations for how the MES can be used to assess the pattern of engagement in MOOCs and to investigate the relationship between learner engagement and other important MOOC teaching and learning factors.<br><br>
				MOOC engagement scale (MES): The MES was developed in this study to capture behavioural, cognitive, emotional and social engagement during the MOOC learning process. The four‐factor structure of the MES was supported by rigorous statistical analyses across multiple samples of MOOC participants. The instrument demonstrates good reliability, content validity, construct validity, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and face validity. The MES is freely available for academic use. <br><br>
				<b>Behavioural engagement (3 items)</b><br>
					1. I set aside a regular time each week to work on the MOOC.<br>
					2. I took notes while studying the MOOC.<br>
    				3. I revisited my notes when preparing for MOOC assessment tasks.<br><br>
    			<b>Cognitive engagement (3 items)</b><br>
    				1. I often searched for further information when I encountered something in the MOOC that puzzled me.<br>
    				2. When I had trouble understanding a concept or an example, I went over it again until I understood it.<br>
    				3. If I watched a video lecture that I did not understand at first, I would watch it again to make sure I understood the content.<br><br>
    			<b>Emotional engagement (3 items)</b><br>
    				1. I was inspired to expand my knowledge in the MOOC.<br>
    				2. I found the MOOC interesting.<br>
    				3. I enjoyed watching video lectures in the MOOC.<br><br>
    			<b>Social engagement (3 items)</b><br>
    				1. I often responded to other learners’ questions.<br>
    				2. I contributed regularly to course discussions.<br>
    				3. I shared learning materials (eg, notes, multimedia, links) with other classmates in the MOOC.<br><br>

				<p id="details">Abstract: This paper presents a narrative review of the literature related to the landscape of learning and teaching in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Past reviews of the MOOC literature have primarily focused on identifying trends and categorising MOOC studies. Syntheses of recent empirical contributions on learning and teaching in MOOCs are scarce. This review evaluated 102 academic studies published between 2014 and 2016 on the learning and teaching aspects of MOOCs. These studies were analysed using Biggs’ 3P Model of Teaching and Learning as an organising framework. The analysis examines four key learning and teaching factors: learner factors, teaching context, learner engagement, and learning outcomes. Five important findings emerged from this analysis: (1) evidence-based research on non-mainstream consumers of MOOCs is scarce; (2) the role of learner factors is oversimplified in evidence-based MOOC research; (3) there is no attempt to reconcile different approaches to measuring learner engagement with MOOCs; (4) measures of learning outcomes lack sophistication and are often based on single variables; and (5) the relationships between many of the key learning and teaching factors have not been clarified. It is argued that continuing to study learning and teaching factors in isolation without considering how they interact with each other does not move the research field forward.

				<summary>Deng, R., & Ritchie, B. W. (2018). International university students’ travel risk perceptions: An exploratory study. <i>Current Issues in Tourism, 21</i>(4), 455-476. </summary>
				<p id="details">Abstract: Tourism researchers have identified the impact of perceived risk on destination choice and travel behaviour, and differences in general traveller risk perceptions based on both traveller and trip characteristics. However, such research has neglected the travel of international university students, despite the expansion and economic importance of this market. This paper outlines an exploratory study conducted on international university students studying at an Australian university. A total of 407 valid responses from the sample were achieved. Factor analysis identified four main risk factors which were labelled ‘human-induced risk’, ‘social–psychological risk’, ‘financial risk’, and ‘health risk’. Student origins were found to influence risk perceptions. In particular, Asian students perceived higher levels of human-induced and social–psychological risks compared with students primarily from America and Europe. Travel experience and repeat visitation significantly reduced risk factors apart from health risks. Financial risks were higher for students planning to travel in Australia compared with Asia and America. The implications for destination marketing are considered, and future research avenues based on the results are outlined.<br><br>

				<p id="details">Abstract: This study reviews research methods commonly adopted in scholarly literature on students’ and instructors’ experiences of using Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), published from January 2014 to April 2016. 53 articles were identified through a search of four electronic databases. The findings show that surveys, interviews, and log files extracted from MOOC platforms were the most frequently adopted methods for data collection. The use of other qualitative research methods such as diary studies and focus groups was less common. The majority of identified articles adopt a single research method. Methodological triangulation is observed in studies which collect data from multiple sources. For studies which adopted methodological triangulation, it is observed that surveys are often triangulated with interviews and log files. The ways in which MOOC scholars use the key research methods are discussed, and future research avenues based on the research results are provided.

				<p id="details">Abstract: This article presents the results of a literature review on key learning and teaching dimensions in MOOCs. 95 studies published from January 2014 to October 2016 were selected for review. Four important learning and teaching dimensions were identified, and relationships between these dimensions were presented. The key dimensions and sub-dimensions reported in this literature review are student factors (education background, country of origin, age, gender , and motivation), teaching context (motivation, challenge, and pedagogical preference), student engagement (emotional, social, behavioural, and cognitive engagement), and learning outcomes (perception, retention, and grade). The review provides evidence of a relationship between student factors and engagement and a relationship between student engagement and learning outcomes.
