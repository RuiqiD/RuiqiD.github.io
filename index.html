                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    Past MOOC research has tended to focus on learning outcomes valued in traditional higher education settings, such as achievement and retention. This study recognises that student ratings are an important alternative outcome measure in MOOCs. This paper adopted a semiautomatic text mining approach to collect and analyse 8475 ratings and reviews submitted for 1794 MOOCs. The analysis revealed six important themes that contributed to positive ratings: ‘learning’, ‘understanding’, ‘interesting’, ‘videos’, ‘recommend’, and ‘questions’. The paper then investigated the characteristics of each identified theme based on the proximity of themes, distribution of concepts within themes, and important connections. Based on research findings, the paper presents the following propositions to assist educators and providers to enhance the learning experience in MOOCs: (1) provide <i>realistic</i> learning contexts and instructional conditions in MOOCs to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge that transfers more readily to <i>real-world practices</i>; (2) carefully design the instructional conditions so that some <i>mental challenge and stimulation</i> is required for learners to achieve a full understanding of the content, rather than making MOOCs too simple or effortless to complete; (3) design the <i>course content, materials, and communications</i> to generate interest; (4) allocate sufficient resources to create <i>high-quality</i> video lectures; (5) employ video lectures to elicit <i>positive</i> emotions from MOOC learners and simplify <i>complex, difficult</i> concepts; and (6) incorporate discussion boards in MOOCs and invest in human and digital resources to address learners’ <i>queries</i>.<br><br>

                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    Prior studies of MOOC learners have focused almost exclusively on behavioural and social aspects of engagement. This paper extends the scope of previous studies by adopting a multi‐dimensional, person‐centred approach to investigate learner engagement in MOOCs. An analysis of 1,452 self‐administered survey responses uncovered three prototypical categories of MOOC learners based on patterns of behavioural, cognitive, emotional and social engagement: (a) 'Individually Engaged' learners, (b) 'Least Engaged' learners, and (c) 'Wholly Engaged' learners. The study revealed significant differences among the three cohorts of MOOC participants with respect to learner factors (gender, origin, motivation), teaching context (course level, course duration, form of the assessment) and learning outcomes (course completion, perceived quality of instruction). The results of this study suggest that adopting a multi‐dimensional, person‐centred approach can be useful for researchers and practitioners to classify MOOC learners into subpopulations, design effective educational interventions that best engage different types of learners, and provide support and scaffolding to individuals with idiosyncratic or problematic engagement patterns.<br><br>
                    <h4>Key findings</h4>
                    1. The study uncovers three prototypical categories of MOOC learners based on their patterns of behavioural, cognitive, emotional and social engagement: 'Individually Engaged' learners, 'Least Engaged' learners, and 'Wholly Engaged' learners.<br>
                    2. ‘Individually Engaged’ learners exhibited a high level of behavioural, cognitive, and emotional engagement and a low level of social engagement.<br>
                    3. ‘Least Engaged’ learners demonstrated a medium level of cognitive and emotional engagement and a low level of behavioural and social engagement.<br>
                    4. ‘Wholly Engaged’ learners displayed the highest level of behavioural, cognitive, emotional, and social engagement across the three cohorts.<br>
                    5. The study reveals significant differences among the three cohorts of MOOC learners with respect to learner factors (gender, origin, motivation), teaching context (course level, course duration, form of the assessment), and learning outcomes (course completion, perceived quality of instruction) (see table below).<br><br>
                    <h4>Implications for practice</h4>
                    1. To optimise engagement and learning outcomes, educators and learning designers should address MOOC participants’ extrinsic motivations (e.g. academic and career needs) when configuring the teaching and learning space.<br>
                    2. Engagement and learning outcomes can be improved by making a course more intellectually stimulating. Educators and learning designers should avoid enticing enrolments by simply making the course easier.<br>
                    3. Engagement can be enhanced by incorporating assessment tasks and taking advantage of human-graded assessment strategies where appropriate.<br>
                    4. Reducing the duration of a MOOC is not the best way to increase engagement.<br><br>

                <div class="content">
                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    The purpose of this study is to contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of conceptualising and measuring learner engagement in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The paper develops and validates a MOOC engagement scale (MES) to measure learner engagement. The initial questionnaire items of the scale were developed by reviewing existing related literature and validated student engagement constructs. This was followed by a modified scale development process, including two focus group interviews (n = 10), an exploratory survey (n = 12), an expert review (n = 10), a pilot survey (n = 15), an item purification study (n = 590) and a construct validation study (n = 303). The final version of the scale is made up of four dimensions: behavioural engagement, cognitive engagement, emotional engagement and social engagement. The paper concludes with recommendations for how the MES can be used to assess the pattern of engagement in MOOCs and to investigate the relationship between learner engagement and other important MOOC teaching and learning factors.<br><br>
                    <h4>Key findings</h4>
                    1. Learner engagement in MOOCs consisted of four components: behavioural engagement, cognitive engagement, emotional engagement and social engagement.<br>
                    2. Learner engagement in MOOCs is multidimensional, and behavioural engagement is distinguished from and only moderately correlated with social engagement.<br>
                    3. MOOC learning should not be treated in the same way as traditional university education. Learner engagement in MOOCs in its current form is constrained by time, space and educational technologies and is less complex than student engagement in face‐to‐face, credit‐bearing university courses.<br>
                    4. A MOOC engagement scale (MES) is developed and validated for measuring learner engagement in MOOCs. The MES provides a common framework for identifying patterns of MOOC engagement for individual learners and highlights the unique role each engagement dimension plays in the learning process.<br><br>
                    <h4>Implications for practice</h4>
                    1. The MES can be used as a diagnostic tool to provide general feedback to instructors regarding the pattern of engagement in MOOCs.<br>
                    2. The MES can be used to identify features of MOOC teaching contexts that facilitate behavioural, cognitive, emotional and social engagement.<br>
                    3. The MES can be used to segment MOOC learners based on their patterns of engagement. Learning resources, activities and environments can be rearranged to address the needs of different cohorts of learners.<br><br>
                    <h4>MOOC engagement scale (MES)</h4>
                        The MES was developed in this study to capture behavioural, cognitive, emotional and social engagement during the MOOC learning process. The four‐factor structure of the MES was supported by rigorous statistical analyses across multiple samples of MOOC participants. The instrument demonstrates good reliability, content validity, construct validity, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and face validity. The MES is freely available for academic use. <br><br>

                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    This paper presents a narrative review of the literature related to the landscape of learning and teaching in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Past reviews of the MOOC literature have primarily focused on identifying trends and categorising MOOC studies. Syntheses of recent empirical contributions on learning and teaching in MOOCs are scarce. This review evaluated 102 academic studies published between 2014 and 2016 on the learning and teaching aspects of MOOCs. These studies were analysed using Biggs’ 3P Model of Teaching and Learning as an organising framework. The analysis examines four key learning and teaching factors: learner factors, teaching context, learner engagement, and learning outcomes. Five important findings emerged from this analysis: (1) evidence-based research on non-mainstream consumers of MOOCs is scarce; (2) the role of learner factors is oversimplified in evidence-based MOOC research; (3) there is no attempt to reconcile different approaches to measuring learner engagement with MOOCs; (4) measures of learning outcomes lack sophistication and are often based on single variables; and (5) the relationships between many of the key learning and teaching factors have not been clarified. It is argued that continuing to study learning and teaching factors in isolation without considering how they interact with each other does not move the research field forward.<br><br>
                    <h4>Key findings</h4>
                    1. The most frequently reported learner factors in MOOC research were education background, country of origin, age, gender, and motivation. Learner factors such as English language ability, employment status, industry background, and previous MOOC experience have not been extensively researched.<br>
                    2. Studies have consistently reported that MOOC participants tended to be highly educated, irrespective of the types of MOOCs they enrolled in or the platforms they used.<br>
                    3. A majority of MOOC participants were from western, developed countries.<br>
                    4. Most MOOC participants tended to be below 45 years old.<br>
                    5. The absence of consistent patterns in participation across genders suggests that gender may also be influenced by teaching context (e.g. MOOC topics).<br>
                    6. Learners displayed a variety of intrinsic, extrinsic, and social motivations for participating in MOOCs.<br>
                    7. MOOC configurations can positively and negatively affect engagement and learning outcomes.<br>
                    8. Empirical evidence of emotional engagement beyond discussion forums was scarce, providing an opportunity to apply a more systematic approach to monitoring and optimising emotional engagement in MOOCs.<br>
                    9. Evidence of the effectiveness of social engagement beyond the use of forums is rare.<br>
                    10. Limited research has been conducted to identify the scope, antecedents, or consequences of cognitive engagement in MOOCs.<br>
                    11. Learning outcomes have been primarily investigated from the perspective of retention and academic performance.<br>
                    12. Retention has been investigated under a number of terms, such as ‘attrition’, ‘persistence’, ‘completion’, ‘retention’, ‘dropout’, and ‘continuance’. The pattern of attrition across different MOOCs and platforms was consistent, featuring a steep drop-off at the start of a course which flattens out in the later weeks and stabilises to an almost negligible rate by the last module. Key reasons for attrition included high workload, difficult or unengaging course content, time management issues, hidden costs, lack of pressure, lack of suitability, no sense of community, and fulfilment of goals.<br>
                    13. More active behavioural engagement and social engagement are associated with higher retention rates and better academic performance.<br>
                    14. Learner engagement has been explored from behavioural, cognitive, emotional, and social perspectives, but no attempt has been made to reconcile the four different approaches to measuring engagement.<br>
                    15. Pre-recorded videos were perceived as a powerful instructional strategy.

                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    This study reviews research methods commonly adopted in scholarly literature on students’ and instructors’ experiences of using Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), published from January 2014 to April 2016. 53 articles were identified through a search of four electronic databases. The findings show that surveys, interviews, and log files extracted from MOOC platforms were the most frequently adopted methods for data collection. The use of other qualitative research methods such as diary studies and focus groups was less common. The majority of identified articles adopt a single research method. Methodological triangulation is observed in studies which collect data from multiple sources. For studies which adopted methodological triangulation, it is observed that surveys are often triangulated with interviews and log files. The ways in which MOOC scholars use the key research methods are discussed, and future research avenues based on the research results are provided.<br><br>

                    This article presents the results of a literature review on key learning and teaching dimensions in MOOCs. 95 studies published from January 2014 to October 2016 were selected for review. Four important learning and teaching dimensions were identified, and relationships between these dimensions were presented. The key dimensions and sub-dimensions reported in this literature review are student factors (education background, country of origin, age, gender , and motivation), teaching context (motivation, challenge, and pedagogical preference), student engagement (emotional, social, behavioural, and cognitive engagement), and learning outcomes (perception, retention, and grade). The review provides evidence of a relationship between student factors and engagement and a relationship between student engagement and learning outcomes.<br><br>

                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    The chapter examines the impact and role of technology on tourism curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment. The chapter starts by considering the importance of technology as a content area in the tourism curriculum. The discussion explores contemporary applications of technologies such as simulations, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), and mobile learning and their impact on pedagogy. The discussion of assessment practice considers how technologies have provided learners and educators with new tools for assuring and verifying learning gains. Challenges, benefits, and future directions are highlighted throughout the chapter. Key themes across the chapter are brought together in the form of a future research agenda for educators and researchers. It is hoped that this chapter will help tourism academics and educators to make informed decisions about the adoption and integration of contemporary educational technologies in their own courses and institutions.<br><br>
