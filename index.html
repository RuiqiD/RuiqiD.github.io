				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				Prior studies of MOOC learners have focused almost exclusively on behavioural and social aspects of engagement. This paper extends the scope of previous studies by adopting a multi‐dimensional, person‐centred approach to investigate learner engagement in MOOCs. An analysis of 1,452 self‐administered survey responses uncovered three prototypical categories of MOOC learners based on patterns of behavioural, cognitive, emotional and social engagement: (a) 'Individually Engaged' learners, (b) 'Least Engaged' learners, and (c) 'Wholly Engaged' learners. The study revealed significant differences among the three cohorts of MOOC participants with respect to learner factors (gender, origin, motivation), teaching context (course level, course duration, form of the assessment) and learning outcomes (course completion, perceived quality of instruction). The results of this study suggest that adopting a multi‐dimensional, person‐centred approach can be useful for researchers and practitioners to classify MOOC learners into subpopulations, design effective educational interventions that best engage different types of learners, and provide support and scaffolding to individuals with idiosyncratic or problematic engagement patterns.<br>
				<h4>Key findings</h4>
				1. The study uncovers three prototypical categories of MOOC learners based on their <b>patterns of behavioural, cognitive, emotional and social engagement</b>: 'Individually Engaged' learners, 'Least Engaged' learners, and 'Wholly Engaged' learners.<br>
				2. ‘Individually Engaged’ learners exhibited a <b>high</b> level of behavioural, cognitive, and emotional engagement and a <b>low</b> level of social engagement.<br>
				3. ‘Least Engaged’ learners demonstrated a <b>medium</b> level of cognitive and emotional engagement and a <b>low</b> level of behavioural and social engagement.<br>
				4. ‘Wholly Engaged’ learners displayed the <b>highest</b> level of behavioural, cognitive, emotional, and social engagement across the three cohorts.<br>
				5. The study reveals significant differences among the three cohorts of MOOC learners with respect to <b>learner factors</b> (gender, origin, motivation), <b>teaching context</b> (course level, course duration, form of the assessment), and <b>learning outcomes</b> (course completion, perceived quality of instruction) (see table below).<br><br>

				<h4>Implications for practice</h4>
				1. To optimise engagement and learning outcomes, educators and learning designers should address MOOC participants’ <b>extrinsic motivations</b> (e.g. academic and career needs) when configuring the teaching and learning space.<br>
				2. Engagement and learning outcomes can be improved by making a course more intellectually stimulating. Educators and learning designers should avoid enticing enrolments by simply making the course <b>easier</b>.<br>
				3. Engagement can be enhanced by incorporating <b>assessment tasks</b> and taking advantage of <b>human-graded assessment strategies</b> where appropriate.<br>
				4. Reducing the <b>duration</b> of a MOOC is not the best way to increase engagement.<br><br>

				<div class="details"><h4>Abstract</h4>
				The purpose of this study is to contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of conceptualising and measuring learner engagement in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The paper develops and validates a MOOC engagement scale (MES) to measure learner engagement. The initial questionnaire items of the scale were developed by reviewing existing related literature and validated student engagement constructs. This was followed by a modified scale development process, including two focus group interviews (n = 10), an exploratory survey (n = 12), an expert review (n = 10), a pilot survey (n = 15), an item purification study (n = 590) and a construct validation study (n = 303). The final version of the scale is made up of four dimensions: behavioural engagement, cognitive engagement, emotional engagement and social engagement. The paper concludes with recommendations for how the MES can be used to assess the pattern of engagement in MOOCs and to investigate the relationship between learner engagement and other important MOOC teaching and learning factors.<br>
    			<h4>Key findings</h4>
    			1. Learner engagement in MOOCs consisted of <b>four components</b>: behavioural engagement, cognitive engagement, emotional engagement and social engagement.<br>
    			2. Learner engagement in MOOCs is <b>multidimensional</b>, and behavioural engagement is <b>distinguished from and only moderately correlated with</b> social engagement. <br>
    			3. MOOC learning should not be treated in the same way as traditional university education. Learner engagement in MOOCs in its current form is constrained by time, space and educational technologies and is <b>less complex</b> than student engagement in face‐to‐face, credit‐bearing university courses.<br>
    			4. A MOOC engagement scale (MES) is developed and validated for measuring learner engagement in MOOCs. The MES provides a common framework for identifying <b>patterns of MOOC engagement</b> for individual learners and highlights the unique role <b>each engagement dimension</b> plays in the learning process.<br>
    			<h4>Implications for practice</h4>
    			1. The MES can be used as a diagnostic tool to provide <b>general feedback</b> to instructors regarding the pattern of engagement in MOOCs.<br>
    			2. The MES can be used to identify <b>features of MOOC teaching contexts</b> that facilitate behavioural, cognitive, emotional and social engagement.<br>
    			3. The MES can be used to <b>segment MOOC learners</b> based on their patterns of engagement. Learning resources, activities and environments can be rearranged to address the needs of different cohorts of learners.<br>
    			<h4>MOOC engagement scale (MES)</h4>
					The MES was developed in this study to capture behavioural, cognitive, emotional and social engagement during the MOOC learning process. The four‐factor structure of the MES was supported by rigorous statistical analyses across multiple samples of MOOC participants. The instrument demonstrates good reliability, content validity, construct validity, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and face validity. The MES is freely available for academic use. <br><br>

				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				This paper presents a narrative review of the literature related to the landscape of learning and teaching in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Past reviews of the MOOC literature have primarily focused on identifying trends and categorising MOOC studies. Syntheses of recent empirical contributions on learning and teaching in MOOCs are scarce. This review evaluated 102 academic studies published between 2014 and 2016 on the learning and teaching aspects of MOOCs. These studies were analysed using Biggs’ 3P Model of Teaching and Learning as an organising framework. The analysis examines four key learning and teaching factors: learner factors, teaching context, learner engagement, and learning outcomes. Five important findings emerged from this analysis: (1) evidence-based research on non-mainstream consumers of MOOCs is scarce; (2) the role of learner factors is oversimplified in evidence-based MOOC research; (3) there is no attempt to reconcile different approaches to measuring learner engagement with MOOCs; (4) measures of learning outcomes lack sophistication and are often based on single variables; and (5) the relationships between many of the key learning and teaching factors have not been clarified. It is argued that continuing to study learning and teaching factors in isolation without considering how they interact with each other does not move the research field forward.
				<h4>Key findings</h4>
				1. The <b>most frequently reported learner factors</b> in MOOC research were education background, country of origin, age, gender, and motivation. Learner factors such as English language ability, employment status, industry background, and previous MOOC experience have not been extensively researched.<br>
				2. Studies have consistently reported that MOOC participants tended to be <b>highly educated</b>, irrespective of the types of MOOCs they enrolled in or the platforms they used.<br>
				3. A majority of MOOC participants were from <b>western, developed countries</b>.<br>
				4. Most MOOC participants tended to be <b>below 45 years old</b>.<br>
				5. The absence of consistent patterns in participation across <b>genders</b> suggests that gender may also be influenced by teaching context (e.g. MOOC topics).<br>
				6. Learners displayed a variety of <b>intrinsic, extrinsic, and social motivations</b> for participating in MOOCs.<br>
				7. <b>MOOC configurations</b> can positively and negatively affect engagement and learning outcomes.<br>
				8. Empirical evidence of <b>emotional engagement</b> beyond discussion forums was scarce, providing an opportunity to apply a more systematic approach to monitoring and optimising emotional engagement in MOOCs.<br>
				9. Evidence of the effectiveness of <b>social engagement</b> beyond the use of forums is rare.<br>
				10. Limited research has been conducted to identify the scope, antecedents, or consequences of <b>cognitive engagement</b> in MOOCs.<br>
				11. Learning outcomes have been primarily investigated from the perspective of <b>retention</b> and <b>academic performance</b>.<br>
				12. <b>Retention</b> has been investigated under a number of terms, such as ‘attrition’, ‘persistence’, ‘completion’, ‘retention’, ‘dropout’, and ‘continuance’. The <b>pattern of attrition</b> across different MOOCs and platforms was consistent, featuring a steep drop-off at the start of a course which flattens out in the later weeks and stabilises to an almost negligible rate by the last module. <b>Key reasons for attrition</b> included high workload, difficult or unengaging course content, time management issues, hidden costs, lack of pressure, lack of suitability, no sense of community, and fulfilment of goals.<br>
				13. More active <b>behavioural engagement</b> and <b>social engagement</b> are associated with higher retention rates and better academic performance.<br>
				14. Learner engagement has been explored from behavioural, cognitive, emotional, and social perspectives, but no attempt has been made to reconcile the <b>four different approaches</b> to measuring engagement.
				<h4>Implications for practice</h4>
				1. <b>Motivations</b> need to be considered for the purpose of conceptualising, designing, developing, and delivering MOOCs. It would be useful to combine <b>two or more variables</b> (e.g. perceived quality of instruction, course completion, academic performance) when evaluating learning outcomes in MOOCs.<br>
				2. <b>Pre-recorded videos</b> featuring instructors were perceived as the most powerful instructional strategy. MOOC learners also valued clear explanations and visualisation of abstract concepts, rich course content, a real-time discussion platform, problem-centric learning, instructor accessibility, active learning, peer interaction, and incorporating a variety of assignments and teaching materials.

				<div class="details"><h4>Abstract</h4>
					Tourism researchers have identified the impact of perceived risk on destination choice and travel behaviour, and differences in general traveller risk perceptions based on both traveller and trip characteristics. However, such research has neglected the travel of international university students, despite the expansion and economic importance of this market. This paper outlines an exploratory study conducted on international university students studying at an Australian university. A total of 407 valid responses from the sample were achieved. Factor analysis identified four main risk factors which were labelled ‘human-induced risk’, ‘social–psychological risk’, ‘financial risk’, and ‘health risk’. Student origins were found to influence risk perceptions. In particular, Asian students perceived higher levels of human-induced and social–psychological risks compared with students primarily from America and Europe. Travel experience and repeat visitation significantly reduced risk factors apart from health risks. Financial risks were higher for students planning to travel in Australia compared with Asia and America. The implications for destination marketing are considered, and future research avenues based on the results are outlined.<br><br>

				<div class="details"><h4>Abstract</h4>
					This study reviews research methods commonly adopted in scholarly literature on students’ and instructors’ experiences of using Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), published from January 2014 to April 2016. 53 articles were identified through a search of four electronic databases. The findings show that surveys, interviews, and log files extracted from MOOC platforms were the most frequently adopted methods for data collection. The use of other qualitative research methods such as diary studies and focus groups was less common. The majority of identified articles adopt a single research method. Methodological triangulation is observed in studies which collect data from multiple sources. For studies which adopted methodological triangulation, it is observed that surveys are often triangulated with interviews and log files. The ways in which MOOC scholars use the key research methods are discussed, and future research avenues based on the research results are provided.

				<div class="details"><h4>Abstract</h4>
					This article presents the results of a literature review on key learning and teaching dimensions in MOOCs. 95 studies published from January 2014 to October 2016 were selected for review. Four important learning and teaching dimensions were identified, and relationships between these dimensions were presented. The key dimensions and sub-dimensions reported in this literature review are student factors (education background, country of origin, age, gender , and motivation), teaching context (motivation, challenge, and pedagogical preference), student engagement (emotional, social, behavioural, and cognitive engagement), and learning outcomes (perception, retention, and grade). The review provides evidence of a relationship between student factors and engagement and a relationship between student engagement and learning outcomes.
